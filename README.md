# closest-pair-doubling

> The implementation in C++ of the closest-pair doubling algorithm which finds the smallest distance between two points in a metric space in *O(n log n)* time without directly using the points' coordinates.  

The algorithm's theory is from the work of Anil Maheshwari, Wolfgang Mulzer and Michiel Smid.
*A Simple Randomized O(N log N)–Time Closest-Pair Algorithm in Doubling Metrics*.
